	Well OK, that&apos;s not exactly true. The trader usually defines a range or channel, and executes all setups within the range, avoiding breakouts all together. (But sure, if they happen, we won&apos;t take them down. ;) )<br /><br />
	The point is to be counter to the market itself and respect the ranges instead of waiting for breakouts or get trapped in fake moves.';
