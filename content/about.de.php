About SwingFish and rules if engagement.

SwingFish startet out with the idea to create a community for traders, a place where the reality that Trading is sort of a lonely profession, is beat by bringing traders together.

to exchange idea's, take on beginners and grow together.

However due to the fact that most places doing this sort of things have a hidden agenda, we do this differently, and so from day 1, all services provided will be free. or combined with a win-win offer.

This has become our rule if engagement, members not following this rule are not welcome!

SwingFish is not a democratic platform nor has any member any privileges or rights at first.
its soley based on Mario Hennenberger's idea to create a better place to trade.

To Protect Members, Traders, copyrights and the general ideology, SwingFish is run and provided by EnFoid Media pte. Ltd. Singapore.

EnFoid does not follow a own business agenda by providing this Service.
