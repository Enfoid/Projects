					<h4 class="swingfish">a few words about SwingFish</h4>
					<p>SwingFish started out with the idea to create a community for traders,<br />
a place where the reality that trading is sort of a lonely profession is countered by bringing traders together, to exchange ideas, take on beginners and grow together.</p>

			<p>However, because most places doing this sort of thing have a hidden agenda, we do this differently, and so from day one all services provided will be free or with a win-win offer. There are also no membership fees, or any other cost involved being a member of the SwingFish community, and never will be!</p>

<p>This has become our rule if engagement, members not following this rule are not welcome!</p>

<p>SwingFish is not a democratic, its solely based on Mario Hennenberger's idea to create a better place to trade.</p>

<p>To protect members, traders, copyrights and the general ideology, SwingFish is run on legal grounds provided by EnFoid Pte. Ltd.</p>

<p>EnFoid does offer the lenders service where lenders can park money without any speculative risks at a guaranteed interest rate. Also, EnFoid does operate partnerships with brokers and forwards discounts directly back to SwingFish members, to eliminate the "conflict of interest" other communities may have.</p>
<p>All of these products are solely made so the SwingFish members have a real gain in being part of this community, instead of being fed misinformation for profit.</p>

				  				<strong>about 3 Years.</strong><br />
				  				Becoming profitable executing a specific strategy is different to becoming profitable generally and in life.<br />
				  				that's why the first step in becoming profitable must be "<strong>not to lose money</strong>" .. ignore strategy and any other things around it, the first and most important mission in becoming profitable is to not lose money, meaning to trade a VERY simple strategy with the main goal not to get less than the deposit over a significant period of trades. after this has been accomplished, then try to work out your strategy and general management to get more successful in what you are doing.</div>
